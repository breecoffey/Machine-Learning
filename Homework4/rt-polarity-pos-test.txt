reviews
although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching .
a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth .
a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .
a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution .
in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby .
return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it's not half-bad .
wise and deadpan humorous .
god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness .
if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .
schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor .
you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards .
it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice .
this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .
sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .
cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . .
presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation .
[jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent .
engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .
a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden .
apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . .
the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance .
what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream .
[it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound .
miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout .
 . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .
assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong's versatile stanley kwan .
delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity .
a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy .
shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life .
it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works .
but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks .
though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see .
ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .
you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .
often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers .
a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .
like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller .
the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game .
a lovely and beautifully photographed romance .
one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years .
its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition .
for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced .
open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations .
one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .
what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration .
neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway .
a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics .
the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .
disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical " bedknobs and broomsticks , " which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .
it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .
dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten .
it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun .
 . . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . .
if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x .
this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
 . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not .
just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one .
austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .
you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .
for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them .
it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more .
late marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love .
an ambitious and moving but bleak film .
it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .
it's sweet . it's funny . it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . and , thanks to the presence of 'the king , ' it also rocks .
it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .
a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events .
the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson .
 " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . .
 . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations .
the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor .
piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying .
very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .
while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .
the cast is phenomenal , especially the women .
a marvel of production design .
the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take .
good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat .
though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film .
is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .
remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .
colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor .
reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness .
significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition .
ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .
a lot smarter than your average bond .
 . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film .
painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .
part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .
so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is .
i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind .
it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .
so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed .
a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition .
the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace .
it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack .
nós gosta muito de as duas torres .
nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right .
all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable .
if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness .
worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees .
a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama .
may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done .
a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .
exhilarating , funny and fun .

writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .

norton is magnetic as graham .
savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense .
