 . . . fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film .
[clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .
although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america .
a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .
a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices .
rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout .
i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow .
more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .
the movie is ingenious fun . see it .
the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
una película oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora .
the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors .
an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .
mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .
spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai .
this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .
this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .

a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .
it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good .
the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
morton deserves an oscar nomination .
a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded .
the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " .
the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert .
for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .
a lovely film for the holiday season .

a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture .
it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor .
at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .
the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .
despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .
this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .
adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel .
a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .
superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations .
not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions .
a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not .
the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him .
like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance .

a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation .

a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up .
lasker's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter .
it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .
cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera .
noyce has worked wonders with the material .
it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence .
the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy .
a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy .
there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys .
vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .
a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script .
dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean .

succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .
the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun .
this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .
a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences .
a weird and wonderful comedy .
the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .

a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film .
labute's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .
in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness .
death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision .
a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that .

munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected .
it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration .

the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .
not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort .
